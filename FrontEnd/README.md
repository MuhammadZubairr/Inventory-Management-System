# Inventory Management — FrontEnd (Static)

This folder contains static, accessible, desktop-first HTML mockups for a university Inventory Management System.

Design constraints:
- Bootstrap 5 (CDN)
- Desktop-first, minimal responsive adjustments
- No animations
- Semantic HTML and a11y-friendly attributes
- Placeholder data only; no backend logic

Pages included:
- `index.html` (redirect links)
- `login.html`
- `dashboard.html`
- `products.html`
- `suppliers.html`
- `stock-in.html`
- `stock-out.html`
- `reports.html`

How to use:
1. Open any file in a browser (e.g., `FrontEnd/index.html`).
2. Pages use Bootstrap from CDN; no build required.

Notes for instructors:
- Files are intentionally simple and accessible.
- All forms are illustrative; they do not submit to a server.
